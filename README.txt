Welcome to my basic Python File Automation script!

[Automation Script]
To use this script, edit the base python script and replace the fields marked with {brackets} with the designated information. 

You will need to designate your file path to the files you want organized. I recommend putting them all in a single parent folder.

You will then need to designate the names of the sorted folders in the array, as well as the parameters for the sorting. I have included a base of five parameters, but this can be adjusted with a simple copy paste. 

[Batch file]
The .bat file is for Windows users that wish to setup a scheduled task to run the script. This makes automation easy. Just edit the .bat file and add the absolute path to your script.

Thank you for checking out my basic automation script!
